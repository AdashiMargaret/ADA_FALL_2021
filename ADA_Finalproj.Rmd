Based on the data above: those who smoked some days had 2% lower odds of having asthma than those who smoked everyday (OR=0.98; 95% CI 0.73,1.32) while those who didnâ€™t smoke at all had 10% greater odds of having asthma than those who smoked every day (OR=1.1; 95% CI 0.91,1.34).

None of the values are greater than 3

#check for goodness of fit 
```{r}

Goodness of fit test was non-significant indicating that model is a good fit

#Check for undue influence
```{r}
#Cook's D plot
plot(smoking2Logit, which=4, id.n=5, col="red") 

#Cook's D cutoff=0.004
cutoff <- 0.004 

#identify observations with a Cook's Distance greater than cutoff
obs_no <- as.data.frame(cooks.distance(smoking2Logit)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(obs_no=row_number()) %>%
  filter(`cooks.distance(smoking2Logit)` > cutoff)

#Let's exclude the values shown in the Cook's D plot, and see how the models compare.

smoking2Logit_new <- update(smoking2Logit,subset=c(-obs_no$obs_no))

summary(smoking2Logit_new)

#compare coefficients between models with and without influential observations
compareCoefs(smoking2Logit, smoking2Logit_new) 
```
After excluding values, the difference between coefficients are very little. We will continue to use the full model with all the observations for this analysis

#To compare the smoking only model with the model with smoking, age and race, we will run a LR test

```{r}
#likelihood ratio test: compare two nested models
lrtest(smoking2Logit, smokingLogit)
```
The absolute values of log likelihood of the smoking only model is larger than the model with both smoking, race and age. Based on the significant p value from LR test, we can conclude that the model with smoking, race and age is better than smoking only model.
